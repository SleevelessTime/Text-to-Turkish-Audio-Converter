# Text-to-Turkish-Audio-Converter
This project is a tool that converts PDF, DOCX, and TXT files into Turkish MP3 audio. It uses gTTS to read the text aloud and generate the MP3 file. The file type is automatically detected, an estimated duration is calculated, and a progress bar shows the process. It can be run easily from the command line.
